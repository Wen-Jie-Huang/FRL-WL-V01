# FRL-WL-V01 Light Prototype IntensityMeasurement
LED white light & 730nm infrared light, 8 channel petri dish culture device. 

The measuring equipment is from TAIWAN HIPOINT CORPORATION.
Light Intensity of FRL (730nm infrared light) is measured using BPFD (350-800nm).
Light Intensity of WL (white light) is measured using PPFD (400-700nm).

Prototype LED lamp beads are manually pasted, resulting in an amplification of the luminous difference.
